                  We buy rough rare gemstones directly from small-scale miners all over the region. We have developed close relationships with these miners over decades. We then cut the material right here in our lapidary factory.

                  There is no middleman; our gemstones come from the ground direct to you!

                  By contrast, every one of our gemstones or jewelry pieces is one-of-a-kind - they donâ€™t have a bar code or a SKU #. Nothing we sell has a quantity above one. This means each item is one of a kind, one in stock, and when it is sold it cannot be replaced. We sell one of a kind, every time.
